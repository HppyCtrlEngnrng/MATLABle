# MATLABle
MATLABle is a Wordle-like game, but you guess MATLAB commands instead of words.

# How To Play
Download and run 'matlable.m' on your MATLAB.
The commands used in the game is taken from names of .m files on your MATLAB's search path under `matlabroot`.
Only commands with names of 5-lowercase letters, like `fplot` or `sound`, are used.
